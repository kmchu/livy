# Livy
Livy was a famous Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome, titled "From the Founding of the City". It is also the name of this simplistic wiki implementation, built on top of Pandoc.

# Usage
1. Create an `.md` file inside the `notes-md` folder
1. Run `make.sh` to use `pandoc` to generate `.html` files from the `.md` files. Alternatively, the added `Makefile` allows Vim users to run the `:make` command instead.
1. Open the generated `index.html` in a web browser
